# Chat Bot

This Kotlin program simulates a basic chatbot interaction, where the bot greets the user, guesses their age based on remainders, counts to a specified number, conducts a programming knowledge test, and ends the conversation.

## Features

- **Greeting**: The chatbot greets the user and provides information about itself.
- **Guess Age**: The bot asks the user for remainders when dividing their age by 3, 5, and 7, and then calculates their age using the Chinese Remainder Theorem.
- **Counting**: The bot counts to a specified number provided by the user.
- **Programming Knowledge Test**: The bot asks the user a multiple-choice question about programming methods and provides feedback on the answer.
- **Conclusion**: The bot ends the conversation with a congratulatory message.

## Usage

1. Run the program.
2. Follow the prompts to interact with the chatbot:
   - Enter your name when prompted.
   - Provide remainders when asked to guess your age.
   - Enter a number when prompted to count.
   - Answer the programming knowledge test question.

## Notes

- The chatbot program is implemented in Kotlin.
- Interaction with the chatbot occurs through console input and output.
- The program utilizes mathematical operations, loops, and conditional statements to simulate conversation and perform tasks.
- ------------------------------------------------

The following knowledge and concepts were utilized in writing this program:

Input/Output Handling: Interaction with the user occurs through console input/output, utilizing the Scanner class for input.

Functions: The program is divided into multiple functions, each responsible for a specific task such as greeting the user, guessing age, counting, conducting a test, and ending the conversation.

Mathematical Operations: Mathematical operations are used to guess the user's age based on remainders and to count numbers up to a given input.

Looping: The program utilizes loops, specifically a for loop, to count numbers up to a given input.

Conditional Statements: A while loop is used for the test section, where the program continues to prompt the user until the correct answer is provided.

Functionality Decomposition: The program decomposes its functionality into smaller, more manageable functions, enhancing code readability and maintainability.
